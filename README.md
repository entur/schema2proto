# schema2proto  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/entur/schema2proto.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/entur/schema2proto)

This tool does 2 things:

* Converts XML Schema files (.xsd) to Protocol Buffers (.proto).
* Modifies existing proto files by adding, modifying and removing fields, messages etc. Also support for merging proto
  files using the same package

# Artifacts

Artifacts are pushed to maven central: https://search.maven.org/search?q=schema2proto

## Usage

### Standalone (Only for converting XSD to PROTO)

See [standalone tool](schema2proto-lib/README.md)

### Maven (Both converting XSD to PROTO and for modifying PROTO files

See [maven plugin](schema2proto-maven-plugin/README.md)

## Maintaining backwards compatibility

If your use case is to maintain a proto descriptor based on a "living" xsd, you will need to detect and possibly resolve
any backwards incompatibility issues that may arise from modifying the xsd.

You can use the tool [protolock](https://github.com/nilslice/protolock) to verify that i.e. fields have not changed name
or id.

If you are using the Maven there is a plugin as well: https://github.com/salesforce/proto-backwards-compat-maven-plugin

Only automatic resolving of field name/id conflicts have been implemented so far.
